 requests_with_proxy is a Python-based tool designed to make web requests using a randomly selected proxy server with custom headers. The code retrieves a list of proxy servers with 100% uptime from a US-based proxy API, selects one at random, and uses it to send a request to a specified URL. This approach is particularly useful for web scraping, where rotating proxies can help bypass IP-based rate limits or restrictions.

Features:
Proxy Rotation: Automatically fetches a list of proxies and selects one at random for each request.
Custom Headers: Supports advanced HTTP headers, including User-Agent, Accept, Accept-Language, and more, to mimic a real browser request.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to manage exceptions during the request process.
Customization: Easily modify the URL, headers, and proxy API endpoint to suit different use cases.

This tool is ideal for developers who need to scrape websites without getting blocked, or anyone interested in learning about making web requests with proxies in Python.

Installation & Usage
1. Install the requests module:
pip install requests
